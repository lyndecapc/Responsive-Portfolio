        <!--Paragraph About Me Goes Here-->
        <p>I am Lynde, a two-time NAIA All-American athlete and a member of Union University's Athletic Hall of Fame.
            I've went from softball player, to my current career as a medical physicist, to working towards a future in
            full stack web development.
        </p>

        <p> In my spare time I enjoy weightlifting, reading, and spending time with my husband and our two terriers.
        </p>

        <p>"The price of success is hard work, dedication to the job at hand, and the determination that whether we win
            or lose, we have applied the best of ourselves to the task at hand." -Vince Lombardi</p>
